# Shinigami

Shinigami is a stand alone Python script for killing errant processes on Slurm based HPC compute nodes.
The script scans for and terminates any running processes not associated with a currently running Slurm job.
Processes associated with whitelisted users (root, administrations, service accounts, etc.) are ignored.
